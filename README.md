# Climate Temperature Forecasting Using Machine Learning  
**OLS, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Diagnostics, Bootstrap Intervals & Ablation Study (1850–2024)**

This project develops a complete and reproducible **machine learning pipeline** to forecast global temperature anomalies using engineered time-series features and classical ML models.  
Using data from **1850–2024**, it achieves strong predictive performance and generates calibrated 10-year climate forecasts (2025–2034).

## 📋 Project Overview
This project forecasts future global temperature anomalies using:

- Multi-year **lag features**
- **Rolling-window** climate signals
- **Trend components**
- Classical ML models (OLS, RF, GBR)
- **Expanding-window evaluation** (time-series safe)
- **Residual diagnostics**
- **Bootstrap prediction intervals**
- **Ablation study** to understand feature importance

The pipeline is designed to be transparent, reproducible, and aligned with scientific forecasting methodologies.
